# Final-project-on-food-delivery-time-prediction
I am Janardhan M presenting my project on data analytics

ABSTRACT

Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The goal of this project is to predict the food delivery time in real-time using various Machine Learning techniques
For the benefit of the customers as well as the service providers, a well analyzed time prediction model will be served
The hectic for providing so many features to get the real-time will be reduced by estimating the most mattering features
