# Final-project-on-food-delivery-time-prediction
I am Janardhan M presenting my project on data analytics

ABSTRACT

Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The goal of this project is to predict the food delivery time in real-time using various Machine Learning techniques
For the benefit of the customers as well as the service providers, a well analyzed time prediction model will be served
The hectic for providing so many features to get the real-time will be reduced by estimating the most mattering features.

STEPS WE FOLLOW FOR PREDICTION

1) Gathering Data: The dataset for our model is available in kaggle. The ref link is listed along with the step.
2) Exploratory data analysis (EDA): We will follow various steps to get the insight of our data- How data looks like? What are the columns and there dtypes? Size of the    dataset? Is the data available in correct format and so on
3) Data wrangling: This step will be followed side by side with EDA. We will handle missing and duplicated values by imputing or droping the relevant values to it. Also    we will remove the unwanted columns which have no relation with our target output
4) Data visualization: We will visualize our selected columns by using EDA like correlation between columns and also finding the relation of various columns using line chart.
5) Preprocessing: Here, we will make data ready for our Machine Learning model by Encoding the categorical columns and by scaling the data
6) Splitting the data: Next, will split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model and the testing set is used to evaluate the    performance of the final model.
7) Selecting and training a model: Then we need to choose a regression algorithm and train it on the training data. We wiill also tune the hyperparameters of the            selected model using cross-validation on the validation set.
8) Evaluating the model: After training the model, we will evaluate its performance on the testing set. we will use metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-          squared to evaluate the model's accuracy.
